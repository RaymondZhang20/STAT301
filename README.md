# STAT301 - Group Project
## Methods: Plan
- In this project we want to `predict the salary of the players for the next season based on player stats i.e., points,assists,blocks,rebounds,steals, etc.`. We will predict this based on the input variables mentioned on the preliminary results above. The good thing about this project is that it will help teams that are on a budget to know what player they should sign based on their stats and how much they should pay the player. 

- Methods to be used in this project are `Multiple Linear Regression Analysis`, `Data visualization`,`Visualizastion of Correlation Matrix`. We are going to use the following $Evaluation$ $Metrics$: `Mean Squared Error(MSE)`, `R-squared`, `Adjusted R-squared` and `Mallow's Cp`.

- Our results will help to determine whether the player is worth his salary, if he should get a raise or be paid less(incase he stays in the same team) based on his performance. It will also help a new organization to be able to come up with a contract that will consist of what performance they expect from the player once signed by the team.
